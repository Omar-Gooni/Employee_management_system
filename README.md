* **Database:** MySQL / MariaDB
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Optionally mention frameworks like Bootstrap, jQuery if used)
* **Web Server:** Apache / Nginx (Recommended)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* A web server (Apache, Nginx, or similar) with PHP support.
* PHP (Version 7.4 or higher recommended).
* MySQL or MariaDB database server.
* A database management tool like phpMyAdmin (optional but helpful).
* Git (for cloning the repository).
* Composer (if PHP dependencies are managed via Composer).

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/employee-management-system.git](https://github.com/your-username/employee-management-system.git)
    cd employee-management-system
    ```

2.  **Database Setup:**
    * Create a new database in your MySQL server (e.g., `employee_db`).
    * Import the database schema and initial data using the provided SQL file. Locate the `.sql` file (e.g., `database/schema.sql` or `database_backup.sql`) in the project directory.
      ```bash
      # Using command line
      mysql -u your_db_user -p your_database_name < database/schema.sql

      # Or use a tool like phpMyAdmin to import the .sql file
      ```

3.  **Configuration:**
    * Locate the database configuration file (e.g., `config/db.php`, `includes/config.php`, or similar).
    * Update the file with your database credentials:
        * Database Host (e.g., `localhost`)
        * Database Name (e.g., `employee_db`)
        * Database User (e.g., `root`)
        * Database Password (e.g., `your_password`)

4.  **Install PHP Dependencies (if using Composer):**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

5.  **Web Server Configuration:**
    * Configure your web server (Apache/Nginx) to point the document root to the project's public directory (this might be the root directory or a specific `/public` folder, depending on your structure).
    * Ensure URL rewriting (like Apache's `mod_rewrite`) is enabled if the project uses friendly URLs.

6.  **Access the Application:**
    * Open your web browser and navigate to the URL configured in your web server (e.g., `http://localhost/employee-management-system` or `http://ems.local`).

## Usage

* **Admin Login:** (If applicable) Provide default admin credentials if they exist (e.g., username: `admin`, password: `password`). *It's highly recommended to change default passwords immediately.*
* Navigate through the menus to access different features like adding employees, viewing lists, managing departments, etc.
